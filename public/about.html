          <p class="blak">
            CALIBRÉ is the annual technical fest conducted by Fr. C. Rodrigues Institute of Technology (FCRIT), Mechanical Engineering Students’ Association in affiliation with Mechanical Engineering Department in the even semester. MESA is an intra-collegiate professional body of students. Under its umbrella, various technical seminars and technical events are conducted, which secure participation from a number of industries and institutes from across the city. We are conducting our Technical Fest known as CALIBRÉ 2k22 from April 7 – April 9, 2022 in collaboration with The Institute of Engineers India, Belapur Local Centre. We have been conducting CALIBRÉ since 2018. After achieving impeccable success since the past 4 years, we are conducting it this year too, but with even more enthusiasm and more interesting events. It was conducted with a prime objective of allowing students of different engineering institutes to showcase their innovative ideas and collaborate with various engineering students, to enable participated students to enhance their skills and knowledge in the field of engineering and share their technical intellect through the projects ,posters and technical papers made by them. CALIBRÉ proves to be a platform for the students mainly from the diploma and degree to present themselves in a professional manner among the emerging engineering students nationwide. It will be a 3 days event in which a National Level Project Poster Competition and National Level Technical Paper Presentation Competition, which will be the highlights of the technical fest, will be conducted with the intention of creating an innovative outlook towards science and technology among the students. Apart from the aforementioned events, we also have events like CADDICT, a CAD modelling-oriented event & Quizophile, a Quiz event. This year we have come up with Three new events crafted specially for our students to have fun and learn!

              <p class="blak">
                FCRIT was established in 1994 and is a part of the Agnel Technical Education Complex at Vashi, which
                itself was established in 1984. The institute is named after late Rev. Fr. Conceicao Rodrigues. FCRIT
                persistently seeks and adopts innovative methods to improve the quality of education on a consistent
                basis. The campus has a cosmopolitan atmosphere with students from all corners of the country.
                Experienced and learned teachers are strongly encouraged to nurture the students. The global standards
                set at FCRIT in the field of teaching spurs the students in relentless pursuit of excellence. In fact,
                it has become a way of life for all at the institute. The highly motivated youngsters on the campus are
                a constant source of pride. FCRIT has, within a short span of time, established itself as a leading
                engineering college in Mumbai University with it's Mechanical ,Electrical and Electronics &
                Telecommunication Engineering Department NBA accredited for 3 years. Though its reputation rests mainly
                on the high quality, value-based technical education that it imparts, it has to its credit a verdant,
                well-maintained Campus and extensive facilities. Its location in the vicinity of the holy places of
                various religious denominations underscores its secular credentials and its philosophy of "Vasudhaiva
                Kuttumbakam".

                MECHANICAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS’ ASSOCIATION popularly called as MESA is a collegiate organization which relates the activities under Mechanical Engineering Department. MESA is among the most active student bodies in the institute. Mentored by experienced faculty members of the Mechanical Engineering department, students take upon many initiatives that prepare them to face the challenges of the future. MESA aims to create opportunities for the students to enhance their knowledge about the latest developments in the technological world by organizing various events. SYNERGY and MESH are the two events conducted every year as a part of activities under MESA. SYNERGY is conducted in the odd semester every year and MESH is conducted in the even semester during the college fest. Both these seminars look forward to provide a broader vision to the students regarding various technologies and developments happening in the professional field outside the college classrooms. In addition to these, since March 2018 MESA has been conducting a technical fest named CALIBRÉ wherein events are organized for the students with the motive of providing a platform for them to learn and show their talents and technical skills.

              <p class="blak">
                The Institution of Engineers (India) [IEI] is a statutory body established in 1920 and incorporated by
                Royal Charter in 1935 to promote and update the advances in engineering and technology. It is the
                largest multi-disciplinary professional body of engineers encompassing 15 (fifteen) engineering
                disciplines with a membership of more than 820 thousand, and serving the nation for more than 9 decades.
                The IEI has its headquarters located in Kolkata with national presence through more than hundred Centres
                and several Overseas Chapters, Foras and Organ. The Institution of Engineers (India) is the first
                professional body to represent India in several International Bodies, such as the World Mining Congress
                (WMC), the World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO), the Commonwealth Engineers Council
                (CEC), the Federation International du Beton (fib), and the Federation of Engineering Institutions of
                South and Central Asia (FEISCA). It also has bilateral agreements with a number of professional
                societies across the globe. IEI holds the International Professional Engineers (IntPE) Register for
                India under the global International Professional Engineers Alliance (IntPEA). The Institution also
